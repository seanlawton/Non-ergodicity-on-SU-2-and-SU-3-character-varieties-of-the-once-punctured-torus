# Non-ergodicity-on-SU-2-and-SU-3-character-varieties-of-the-once-punctured-torus-
Utilizing KAM theory, we show that there are certain levels in relative SU(2) and SU(3) character varieties of the once-punctured torus where the action of a single hyperbolic element is not ergodic.  The Mathematica Notebooks posted here are used to make the computations.
