# Non-ergodicity-on-SU-2-and-SU-3-character-varieties-of-the-once-punctured-torus
Utilizing KAM theory, we show that there are certain levels in relative SU(2) and SU(3) character varieties of the once-punctured torus where the action of a single hyperbolic element is not ergodic.  The Mathematica Notebooks posted here are used to make the computations.

The Mathematica Notebooks each do roughly what their titles say.  There is documentation in the notebooks so that someone reading the paper (available on arXiv and with the same title as this repo) should be able to navigate the code.  

Additionally there are two *.m files that must be loaded for some of the notebooks (this is indicated in the notebooks).
